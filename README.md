The index itself is in index.md

An index of DFT and other electron structure methods. Originally intended as a counterpart to the NIST Basis Set Repository, my (perhaps naive) hope is that this can be both a 'first port of call' for anyone contemplating quantum mechanical calculations in molecules or solids, and as a way of recording successes, caveats or troublesome classes of systems for each tabulated method. Please contribute to this body of knowledge, and try to make it widely known with the scientific community. Or take the concept and do it better.
